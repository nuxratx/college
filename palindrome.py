palindrome.py

'''Create a python script that will check if a particular string is a palindrome or not.  
(Reads the same forwards and backwards). You can either pass the string as an argument or ask for user input
A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string. For example, “radar” is a palindrome, but “radix” is not a palindrome '''
